## The Why's
I decided to create this project while following The Odin Project curriculum, and specifically decided to style it like a Whatsapp Chat because everyone else had wonderful submission, full of incredible ideas.
## The Structure
The project structure is really easy, in the assets folder resided every asset needed for the execution, there is the mainpage, named index.html (it is a single page app, so only one HTML file exists), the CSS is an external file, named style.css and finally the JS code resides all in the main.js script.
